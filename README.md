TIFF Metadata Processor

This Java program demonstrates how to create a TIFF image with custom metadata, including resolution information. The code uses the Java Image I/O API and the JAI ImageIO library for handling TIFF images.
Features

    Custom Metadata: Adds custom metadata to the TIFF image, including X and Y resolution tags.

Usage

    Set Image Size and Resolution:
        Adjust the size of the BufferedImage as needed in the main method.
        Set your desired resolution (e.g., 300 DPI) in the resolution variable.

    Specify Output File Path:
        Update the outputPath variable with the desired output file path.

    Run the Program:
        Execute the main method to create the TIFF image with custom metadata.
